# Psitegrad-Buyable-Unique-Hats

Ever misplaced your precious one of kind hat that you received after a quest ?  
Now you can buy it again !  


### Description

This mod adds all the unique hats to the Supply Shop item list.  
I put a condition so that you can only buy a hat once you're one whistle rank higher than when you are able to obtain it (with one exception).
